I'm Emre, living in 🇹🇷 and working as a Cloud Native Engineer at <a href="bestcloudfor.me">bestcloudfor.me ☁️</a>

As a teenager, I was the kid people approached about their technical issues. I formatted many computers, changed many ringtones, and repaired many satellite receivers. I was the go-to guy for resolving any technical problems.

Today not much has changed. I still help people by resolving their problems but in a professional way.
